# restful-bookstore

This is a personal project that uses Express as a Restful back-end API and AngularJS as a front-end. 
The back-end and front-end will run on separate localhost ports, to simulate a more real world scenario where they'd be on different servers. 
My main focus is the front-end, but I'm building out a back-end (instead of just using JSON files) so I can visualize the server-side functionality 
of the app in a more concrete way.

###Project Goals
To practice:
- creating and working with APIs
- CORS
- AngularJS
